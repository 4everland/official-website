We are proud to announce that 4EVERLAND is integrating with Polygon, a leading platform for Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development.

4EVERLAND will provide DWeb Hosting services to Polygon ecosystem applications, further improving data uploading, downloading, visit and other cloud computing services. 4EVERLAND will promote the development of Web3.0 for Polygon ecology, and help more projects to make a smooth leap from Web2.0 to Web3.0.

4EVERLAND is committed to providing a new set of IPFS-based front-end deployment and hosting services that enable permanent access to projects and data security. This will also serve over 3000+ projects in the Polygon ecosystem (https://awesomepolygon.com/ ). We want to free Web 3.0 developers from the shackles of centralization by providing users with a globally accelerated, perpetual network service. All developers are welcome to deploy and host their websites at 4EVERLAND, and those who do so will be rewarded.

Polygon has a thriving ecosystem and robust infrastructure as the first well-structured, easy-to-use platform for Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development. More than 3,000 projects in the Polygon ecosystem thrive on the power of Polygon. 4EVERLAND will use Polygon’s Full-stack scaling solution for better development, governance, and settlement in the future. We believe that by integrating with Polygon, we will provide developers with a better experience, reduce development costs, and accelerate Web 3.0 development.

The Internet today needs Web 3.0. It is a huge leap forward towards the future of the internet. Therefore, developers worldwide need to come forward and help in building this unbiased decentralized network.
