Dear User,

Today, we are pleased to announce that our First Landing Event rewards distribution date is finally confirmed! We wanted to thank everyone again for participating in the First Landing Event.

We had around 23,000 developers deploy more than 27,000 DApps and over 50 million visitors during the event. This is a major step for 4EVERLAND. We are positive that we can together rebuild the web’s foundation layer and using our platform, you as users can smoothly transition to a new and unbiased Web 3.0.

## Time to Claim Your Rewards!

The claim will start on October 21, 2021 at 13:30 UTC, so please log into the 4EVERLAND hosting page and claim the rewards to your ETH wallet address.

Since we are still in the process of developing our current product, the reward token is called T-4EVER (i.e., Temporary 4EVER). It will be used as a voucher for all future 1:1 exchanges of the official 4EVER tokens. T-4EVER contract address: 0xeaba187306335dd773ca8042b3792c46e213636a

### Reclaiming Rewards from Malicious Accounts

As informed previously, we found several accounts with malicious behaviours. All these malicious accounts will be notified via email.

There were around 10 million T-4EVER rewards that were gained from malicious behaviours, which we will reclaim and distribute as follows:

- 50% will be distributed equally among all good participants.
- 50% of the remaining will be supplemented to our Grants program that will support more excellent developers just like you.

In case you disagree with our judgment, please contact us via email and file a complaint on or before October 28, 2021 at 23:59 UTC, and we will investigate it. Email: contact@4everland.org

In the meantime, our Developer Grants activity is still open, so feel free to apply if you have a great project or even an idea or a simple plan. Click this link for more details: https://www.4everland.org/firstlanding/grants/

### Limited NFT

All developers who participated in First Landing Event will receive a limited first series of 4EVERLAND NFTs which has the 4EVERLAND’s special and exclusive logo.

The limited NFT will be automatically minted to your ETH wallet address during the claim process.

In the future, 4EVERLAND will also be releasing a series of commemorative NFTs to be airdropped to users during important milestones. 4EVERLAND will offer exclusive eco-benefits to these NFT users in future. So, keep an eye on all our social media pages to be the first ones to avail these benefits. Thank you.
