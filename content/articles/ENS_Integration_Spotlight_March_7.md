4EVERLAND Hosting now offers ENS+IPNS support, allowing all users to deploy and access IPFS sites in a secure, efficient, and cost-effective manner. We upgraded and optimized the 4EVERLAND Hosting technology to support the ENS domain name system, providing users with more convenient Dweb deployment services.

In this tutorial, we will be learning how to quickly deploy decentralized websites on IPFS.

How to:
- Deploy a static website using 4EVERLAND Hosting
- Register an ENS domain name
- Supports InterPlanetary Name System (IPNS)

## 4EVERLAND Hosting Can Help You Deploy a Static Website

4EVERLAND [Hosting](https://www.4everland.org/hosting/) was launched to act as a one-stop decentralized front-end deployment service based on IPFS that includes encryption, peer-to-peer (P2P), and privacy, allowing developers to deploy and manage IPFS sites easily and quickly.

4EVERLAND Hosting offers not one but two one-click deployment methods:
- GitHub code repository 
- Template

Users can choose from any of these methods depending upon their personal needs to achieve a decentralized front-end deployment.

Once you have followed the tutorial and successfully deployed your site, 4EVERLAND will automatically pin it to the IPFS site. You can view IPFS Hash in the ‘Build log.’ You can browse the IPFS-based websites via Opera browser by visiting ipfs://[IPFS Hash].

## To Register an ENS Domain Name

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain. In comparison to the DNS domain name system, ENS is decentralized, anti-censored where users have full control of the domain name system.

**Please Note:** Do make sure your available domain name is registered on the ENS [website](https://app.ens.domains/) before you bind it.

## InterPlanetary Name System (IPNS)

You may be aware of how the IPFS content hashes change every time you update the website, which means that ENS domain hash updates also must be made manually after every update to the content of the site.

4EVERLAND Hosting has a solution for this issue. We now support the InterPlanetary Name System (IPNS), thus helping solve this very issue by creating an address that can be updated easily.
