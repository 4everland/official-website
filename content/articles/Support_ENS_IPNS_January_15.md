4EVERLAND Hosting now supports Ethereum Name Service (ENS), enabling all users to bind their InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) deployments to their own traditional DNS domains as well as the new ENS domains.

We have also leveraged InterPlanetary Name System (IPNS) + ENS to make ENS and IPFS hash record updates — scalable, fast, and inexpensive on 4EVERLAND platform.

## Hosting+ENS

4EVERLAND Hosting has been favourably accepted by developers all over the world since its launch, enabling them to quickly build websites, web applications, or native applications based on IPFS with integrated privacy, encryption, and p2p features.

Both ENS and 4EVERLAND team aims to be the infrastructure of Web 3.0 and provides more power to all Web 3.0 developments. ENS offers a decentralized, censorship-resistant, and user-controlled domain naming system for websites, Dapps, and other Dweb resources/services. Instead of DNS, which is maintained by a central authority, ENS is censorship-resistant and runs on smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

We have therefore upgraded and optimised the 4EVERLAND Hosting technology to support the ENS domain name system, providing users with a more convenient Dweb deployment services. Users can now easily bind an ENS domain name to their IPFS site and have the content automatically updated for future deployment by using the 4EVERLAND Hosting services which supports the ENS domain name system.

The combination of Hosting and ENS allows all Dweb users to be truly decentralised without having to rely on traditional centralized services.

## IPNS+ENS

The key issue with ENS updates and transactions is that IPFS content hashes changes with every deployment, therefore you must alter the hash each time on your domain.

Now what if we used ENS for a different type of record that would not change on each deployment, but reference a different IPFS hash which we could update without having to trigger multiple transactions on the Ethereum network?

For that reason, 4EVERLAND uses IPNS to update ENS domains.

The InterPlanetary Name System (IPNS) was designed by the IPFS team to solve this issue by creating an address that can be updated.

We can now set a static IPNS address and make IPFS hash updates in layer 2, rather than altering your IPFS hash on your ENS name.

In this way, we can reduce ENS transactions to just 1 without losing the distributed/decentralized privileges of IPFS and ENS. When a user adds an ENS domain, a transaction is performed to change the ENS domain content hash to the new IPNS address.
From then on, all future IPFS hash updates a user makes, change or deployment will be done on that site’s specific IPNS address record, at zero cost, without any gas fees. It’s not only scalable but also fast and cost effective.

## How to add an ENS domain on 4EVERLAND?

Step1: Deploy a project on 4EVERLAND
Here is the quick guide to deploy a project on 4EVERLAND: https://docs.hosting.4everland.org/guide/#_4everland-hosting

Step2: Select the project that you want to add an ENS domain
Visit https://hosting.4everland.org/#/dashboard/projects and select the project that you want to add an ENS domain.

Step3: Add the ENS domain.
Click Settings → Domains → Add the ENS domain

Step4: Pay the fee and complete the verification by connecting your MetaMask wallet.

Step5: Your ENS domain has been added successfully, now jump to verify the details by clicking on the domain name.

## About ENS

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain. ENS’s job is to map human-readable names like ‘alice.eth’ to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses, other cryptocurrency addresses, content hashes, and metadata.

### Advantages of ENS

- Allows for human-readable wallet addresses meaning you can send funds to a domain name
- Can allow for easy access to Swarm and IPFS content hashes
- Better security than DNS as ENS runs on the Ethereum block chain as a set of smart contracts
- You can create subdomains
- Domains and subdomains can be resold
