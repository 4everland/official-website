It all began back in 2019 when the Arweave team had proposed a collaboration of both parties to strengthen the combined efforts to create a ‘bridge’ between IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and Arweave. They believed that such integration would form the foundation of a future open, decentralized network and ecosystem that can offer developers a wider range of services and a deeper ecological infrastructure.

This concept materialized only in the year 2022, when 4EVERLAND Bucket was launched and was successful in integrating with Arweave, as a decentralized data storage protocol. This integration enables users to synchronize their data to the Arweave network using the 4EVERLAND Bucket with just one click. Bucket, in short, allows users to effectively double backup data to IPFS and Arweave networks for decentralized permanent data storage.

**Here are some of 4EVERLAND’s Bucket features:**
· It supports decentralized wallet login and is censorship-resistant.
· It supports synchronous storage to Arweave and IPFS networks.
· It supports AR gateway verification.
· It provides a global gateway node acceleration service.
· It is also compatible with AWS S3 APIs.

**Please Note:** During the public beta period, all users can get 100 MB Arweave storage space for free, you are more than welcome to explore and experience it. So,

## 4EVERLAND-Bucket Offers a Dedicated Global Network Acceleration Service

The Bucket provides a dedicated gateway for all users. It also provides a fast global network acceleration service for all files stored in Arweave.

When it comes to fetching files from the Arweave, everyone wants it to be as fast as possible. However, the longer it takes to fetch the content, the slower the response time becomes. Since the public gateway’s services are open and available to everyone, the whole experience is not pleasing to all.

Therefore, Bucket users rely on 4EVERLAND’s globally distributed gateway nodes to provide global acceleration services. Arweave’s resources are cached in advance in globally distributed gateways to ensure that users can save and serve content as quickly as possible on Arweave.

Furthermore, the 4EVERLAND gateway node improves data storage, access, reading, and transmission to significantly improve Data I/O processing efficiency. Meantime, DDNS (Dynamic Domain Name Service) continuously monitors the nodes’ operation status, ensuring that users’ requests are automatically resolved to the most appropriate gateway node, allowing for quick access to storage resources.

## 4EVERLAND-Bucket Allows You to Enjoy Ecological Infrastructure and Services

In the year 2014, Juan Benet launched the IPFS project, with the aim of addressing the limitations of existing centralized storage and allowing users to implement distributed data storage in a low-risk, low-cost, and censorship-resistant way.

After 8 years of development, the IPFS ecosystem now includes a variety of things, such as apps, developer tools, and infrastructure. The infrastructure technologies and other services available in the huge ecosystem empower users better.

In the year 2021, Arweave proved with stats that storage is a vital part of blockchain infrastructure. Projects with high storage demand, such as NFT, have embraced Arweave, thus enabling its ecosystem to grow quickly.
As the two ecologies mature, the requirement for an interoperable bridge to maximize users’ access to both ecologies’ infrastructure and services becomes clearer.

Therefore, 4EVERLAND Bucket, a decentralized storage solution based on IPFS, now officially integrates with the Arweave storage underlying protocol, designed to allow users to enjoy diversified infrastructure and services while storing data efficiently, conveniently, cost-effectively, and censorship-resistant permanently.

## 4EVERLAND-Bucket is Compatible With Traditional Storage Development Experience

4EVERLAND aims to help users make a smooth leap from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0. The Bucket was, in fact, designed from the ground up to be compatible with the traditional development methods, so that users can create Web 3.0 apps without having to change their workflow.

The Bucket is AWS S3 compatible, so you can use the S3 CLI and APIs to interact with your Bucket and use CLI for uploading and managing Arweave files.

By using the AWS CLI and development toolkit, users can now upload and secure files to Arweave in the 4EVERLAND Bucket using any language used to build the application, including JavaScript, Go, C++, Python, and Ruby.

These operations are, of course, fully compatible with Arweave, making it simple for users to upload and store files in 4EVER-Bucket.

## 4EVERLAND-Bucket Supports Diversified Payment Models

4EVERLAND Bucket simplifies and supports the payment mode of storage space, which is more acceptable for users’ storage payment habits and provides a more convenient development experience for developers, based on the existing payment mode of storage products.
4EVERLAND will also combine with ecological development and innovate the way to get storage space. Bucket now offers 1GB IPFS storage space and 100MB AR storage space for all users for free. In the future, users are expected to obtain storage space through project sponsorship, token economy-related operations, etc.

## How to store your data to Arweave network with 4EVERLAND Bucket

- Login with your MetaMask wallet.
- Select whether to open the AR Sync button when creating a New Bucket.
- You can check the AR sync status on the Bucket or Folder homepage, and you can also open the ‘Sync to AR’ button to synchronize data if you need it.
- You can check the AR hash, IPFS hash, URL on the File Info page, click the ‘Verify on AR’ button at the top of the page to jump to the AR browser for verification. If you want to download the file, click ‘Download’ directly.
- You can view all the data you have synchronized to the AR network by clicking AR History.

For detailed documentation, please see the [Bucket docs](https://docs.bucket.4everland.org/guide/).

**That’s it, we hope you enjoy using 4EVERLAND Bucket and Arweave, let us know in the comments below what you think and who we should integrate with next.**

##About ARWEAVE

Arweave is a new type of storage that backs data with sustainable and perpetual endowments, allowing users and developers to truly store data forever — for the very first time. As a collectively owned hard drive that never forgets, Arweave allows us to remember and preserve valuable information, apps, and history indefinitely. By preserving history, it prevents others from rewriting it.

## About 4EVERLAND

4EVERLAND is a Web 3.0 cloud computing platform with global acceleration, privacy protection, distributed storage and other technical features. Based on IPFS and the underlying technology of Ethereum, 4EVERLAND is committed to providing a distributed, highly efficient, self-motivated, and low-cost data hosting gateway, and becoming the infrastructure for millions of Web3.0 developers and applications.

4EVERLAND realizes the need for inter-blockchain communication and interoperability between multiple chains and so it utilizes the IBC technology to integrate with the underlying public chains such as Ethereum, BSC, Solana, Polygon, and Filecoin. Similarly, 4EVERLAND also provides a distributed, high-efficiency, self-incentivized, and low-cost data hosting network based on an open protocol system like IPFS to meet developers’ requests for inter-blockchain communication, decentralized front-end, and write once, run any blockchain, making it easier to quickly build Web 3.0 applications.
