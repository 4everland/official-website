## Community Work

- 4EVERLAND Provides One-Stop Dweb Solution for Harmony Ecosystem
4EVERLAND are pleased to announce that we brings a one-stop IPFS-based front-end service to the Harmony ecosystem and serves as the infrastructure for Web3 to advance the Harmony ecosystem. 4EVERLAND provides DDNS, Data I/O, Cert Manager, and other modules in the gateway layer, which are compatible with Web2 access experience. Developers can quickly complete DWeb deployment in minutes without any plug-ins and additional learning costs.

- Dev Grant Spotlight: 4EVERLAND
Filecoin Foundation awarded 4EVERLAND a microgrant in recognition of its platform’s success and what these achievements are doing to enhance the Filecoin ecosystem. 4EVERLAND has already built a number of efficient storage nodes based on IPFS and is committed to developing API and SDK applications based on IPFS and Filecoin. This is continually making it easier and faster for developers to leverage Filecoin in building Web3 applications.

- Release Update — 4EVERLAND Hosting Now Supporting ENS+IPNS!
4EVERLAND now integrates ENS to enable any ENS domain holder to quickly build their own DWeb on IPFS using 4EVERLAND. We have also leveraged InterPlanetary Name System (IPNS) + ENS to make ENS and IPFS hash record updates — scalable, fast, and inexpensive on 4EVERLAND platform.
