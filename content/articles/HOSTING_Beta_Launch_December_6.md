Attention! 4EVERLAND Community!

Today, we are pleased to announce that our Hosting Beta version is officially launched, after a period of development and iteration. We welcome all to experience the new Hosting, which will be more focused on developers’ experience and diverse needs.

As we are forwarding to Web 3.0, this is an important step so let’s enter the Web 3.0 world together.

We decided to launch the Hosting Beta version after receiving a lot of support from developers since the launch of our first DWeb deployment product — Hosting Alpha in August 2021.

As of now, we have provided front-end deployment and hosting services for over 30,000 Dapps, serving over 23,000 developers from 100+ cities. During this period, we received a lot of constructive feedback from developers, that gave us a lot of fresh ideas to improve our Hosting services.

A big thank you to all developers for your feedback and support.
Now, Let move on to the features that Hosting Beta version offers:

## Hosting Beta Version Features

### Data Statistics

From the initial statistics module, Hosting Beta has now been enhanced to analyze website data in two dimensions: user analysis & request and visualizing the results in data transfer.

By using this function, you can now analyze the number of users, their regional distribution, the source of their visits, operating system, device type, and other factors to optimize your website, which will increase the number of visitors to your website and improve the publicity for your project.

### Better Global Acceleration

Hosting Beta uses a new global gateway node that provides global acceleration services for websites that are faster and more stable. We’ve improved and enhanced the original gateway’s architecture, as well as added more gateways throughout the world, to significantly increase network throughput and high availability, resulting in a more efficient and convenient global acceleration service for all 4EVERLAND websites.

### Additional Services

Kindly check the changelog for more optimizations and upgradations to the Hosting Beta version and we also invite you to try out and discover them too!

Simultaneously, look out for Hosting Cli which will be launched soon, so stay tuned!
