## Community Work

- 4EVERLAND — Seeking to End Cult of Personality Among Developers in Web3
Fantom Senior Solutions Architect Anton Nell stated that both he and star developer Andre Cronje have decided to stop contributing to the Fantom Foundation, which is one of the most impactful DeFi and cryptocurrency spaces in the blockchain industry. Such a announcement means that there is still a crucial problem with the current Web 3.0 paradigm of blockchain: the front-end of most projects is still deployed by centralized cloud service providers and individual computer rooms such as traditional AWS. It is precisely for this reason that 4EVERLAND came into existence. 4EVERLAND is a cloud computing platform driven by blockchain technology and designed for Web3.0, helping developers to efficiently develop Web3.0 applications.
