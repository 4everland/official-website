Web3.0 is not only a web revolution for users, but also for centralized service providers.

Hosting your front-end entirely on a centralized server is not a wise choice;
It can’t avoid the outage, data security, censorship, etc. that come with centralized services. But IPFS-based front-end is a wise way to avoid most of these problems.

We are pleased to announce that 4EVERLAND brings a one-stop IPFS-based front-end service to the Harmony ecosystem and serves as the infrastructure for Web3 to advance the Harmony ecosystem.

4EVERLAND provides DDNS, Data I/O, Cert Manager, and other modules in the gateway layer, which are compatible with Web2 access experience. Developers can quickly complete DWeb deployment in minutes without any plug-ins and additional learning costs.

4EVERLAND is also providing global acceleration and data analysis services for all front-ends that are deployed on 4EVERLAND, which will make for more helpful project operation and maintenance.

In addition to the gateway provided by 4EVERLAND, the front-end deployed can be accessed through any IPFS public gateways, Really saving the project from the risk of the front-end outage. Whether used as an alternate site or a main site, an IPFS-based front-end is necessary for every project.
