Hello 4EVERLAND Community!

We are pleased to announce that ‘4EVERLAND-BUCKET’ our very first decentralized storage product built on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is now open and available as public beta for all users!

After 4EVERLAND-Hosting, this is our second IPFS-based product. BUCKET enables users to upload, store, PIN, and fetch files from the IPFS in a secure, convenient, and efficient manner. BUCKET is also compatible with AWS S3 application programming interface, CLI, and other upload methods, making it easier for users to use our product.

## Benefits of 4EVERLAND-Bucket 
- It is easier for Web 3.0 developers to create and manage content on IPFS
- It supports a wide range of files such as videos, images, text, etc.
- It provides decentralized storage for various applications including NFT, Metaverse, GameFi, and DApps.
- It is compatible also with Web 2.0, so all users can benefit and use Bucket for storage services and enjoy Web 3.0 functionality.

## 4EVERLAND-BUCKET Features
- It is a Dedicated Globally Accelerated IPFS Gateway
Bucket offers a dedicated IPFS gateway for all users. The dedicated gateway provides faster access to branded content for NFT and DeFi applications.

When it comes to fetching files from the IPFS, everyone wants it to be as fast as possible. However, the longer it takes to fetch the content, the slower the response time becomes.

Therefore, 4EVERLAND’s promotes a global distribution of the gateway nodes. Bucket offers users with global acceleration, so they can store and serve content on IPFS as soon as possible.

Similarly, Bucket enables users to set up **custom domains** as easily as setting up a personal blog, allowing them to personalize their dedicated gateway.

- It has a Programmable Interface which is Compatible with AWS S3 APIs
4EVERLAND aims to help users make a smooth leap from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0. 4EVER-Bucket was, in fact, designed from the ground up to be compatible with the traditional development methods, so that users can create Web 3.0 apps without having to change their workflow.

Bucket is AWS S3 compatible, so you can use the S3 CLI and APIs to interact with your Bucket and use CLI for uploading and managing IPFS files.

By using the AWS CLI and development toolkit, users can now upload and secure files to IPFS in the 4EVER-Bucket using any language used to build the application, including JavaScript, Go, C++, Python, and Ruby.

**Please Note:** All those who will use 4EVERLAND-Bucket during the public beta period will additionally receive 1GB of free storage, so do feel free to try it and make the utmost use of this offer.
