          Welcome to 4EVERLAND. Please read on to learn the rules and
          restrictions that govern your use of our website(s), products,
          services and applications.If you have any questions, comments, or
          concerns regarding these terms or the Services, please contact us in
          support@4everland.org.These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are a binding
          contract between you and 4EVERLAND Labs . You must agree to and accept
          all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the Services.
          Your using the Services in any way means that you agree to all of
          these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the
          Services. These Terms include the provisions in this document, as well
          as those in the Privacy Policy and Copyright Dispute Policy
          (4EVERLAND.org/#/copyright).
        </p>

        <p>
          NOTICE: Please read these Terms carefully. They cover important
          information about Services provided to you and any charges, taxes, and
          fees we bill you. These Terms include information about future changes
          to these Terms, limitations of liability, a class action waiver, and
          resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may
          need to change along with the Services. We reserve the right to change
          the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your
          attention by placing a notice on the https://4everland.orgwebsite, by
          sending you an email, and/or by some other means.If you don’t agree
          with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that
          means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the
          Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that
          means you agree to all of the changes.
        </p>

          A violation of any of the foregoing is grounds for termination of your
          right to use or access the Services.
        </p>

        <p>What are my rights in the Services?</p>

        <p>
          The materials displayed or performed or available on or through the
          Services, including, but not limited to, text, graphics, data,
          articles, photos, images, illustrations, User Submissions, and so
          forth (all of the foregoing, the “Content”) are protected by copyright
          and/or other intellectual property laws. You promise to abide by all
          copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions
          contained in any Content you access through the Services, and you
          won’t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast,
          transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell,
          commercialize or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not
          owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of that
          Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else’s (including
          Terminal’s) rights. You understand that 4EVERLAND owns the Services.
          You won’t modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or
          sale of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section),
          create derivative works based on, or otherwise exploit any of the
          Services. The Services may allow you to copy or download certain
          Content; please remember that just because this functionality exists,
          doesn’t mean that all the restrictions above don’t apply they do
        </p>

        <p>Do I have to grant any licenses to 4EVERLAND or to other users?</p>

        <p>
          Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through
          the Services is your “User Submission.” Some User Submissions may be
          viewable by other users. In order to display your User Submissions on
          the Services, and to allow other users to enjoy them (where
          applicable), you grant us certain rights in those User Submissions.
          Please note that all of the following licenses are subject to our
          Privacy Policy 4EVERLAND.org/#/privacy<em>and</em>policy to the extent
          they relate to User Submissions that are also your
          personally-identifiable information
        </p>

        <p>
          For all User Submissions, you hereby grant4EVERLAND a license to
          translate, modify (for technical purposes, for example making sure
          your content is viewable on an iPhone as well as a computer) and
          reproduce and otherwise act with respect to such User Submissions, in
          each case to enable us to operate the Services, as described in more
          detail below. This is a license only – your ownership in User
          Submissions is not affected
        </p>

        <p>
          If you store a User Submission in your own personal 4EVERLAND account,
          in a manner that is not viewable by any other user except you (a
          “Personal User Submission”), you grant 4EVERLAND the license above, as
          well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Personal
          User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Personal User
          Submission accessible to you and providing the Services necessary to
          do so.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you share a User Submission only in a manner that only certain
          specified users can view (for example, a private message to one or
          more other users)(a “Limited Audience User Submission”), then you
          grant 4EVERLAND the licenses above, as well as a license to display,
          perform, and distribute your Limited Audience User Submission for the
          sole purpose of making that Limited Audience User Submission
          accessible to such other specified users, and providing the Services
          necessary to do so. Also, you grant such other specified users a
          license to access that Limited Audience User Submission, and to use
          and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of
          the Services.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you share a User Submission publicly on the Services and/or in a
          manner that more than just you or certain specified users can view a
          “Public User Submission”), then you grant 4EVERLAND the licenses
          above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your
          Public User Submission for the purpose of making that Public User
          Submission accessible to all 4EVERLAND users and providing the
          Services necessary to do so, as well as all other rights necessary to
          use and exercise all rights in that Public User Submission in
          connection with the Services and/or otherwise in connection with
          Terminal’s business. Also, you grant all other users of the Services a
          license to access that Public User Submission, and to use and exercise
          all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services.
        </p>

        <p>
          You agree that the licenses you grant are royalty-free, perpetual,
          sublicensable, irrevocable, and worldwide.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, you understand and agree that 4EVERLAND, in performing the
          required technical steps to provide the Services to our users
          (including you), may need to make changes to your User Submissions to
          conform and adapt those User Submissions to the technical requirements
          of connection networks, devices, services, or media, and the foregoing
          licenses include the rights to do so.
        </p>

        <p>
          What if I see something on the Services that infringes my copyright?
        </p>

        <p>
          You may have heard of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the
          “DMCA”), as it relates to online service providers, like 4EVERLAND,
          being asked to remove material that allegedly violates someone’s
          copyright. We respect others’ intellectual property rights, and we
          reserve the right to delete or disable Content alleged to be
          infringing, and to terminate the accounts of repeat alleged
          infringers; to review our complete Copyright Dispute Policy and learn
          how to report potentially infringing content, click here

        </p>

        <p>Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Services?</p>

        <p>
          Any information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted
          through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from
          whom such content originated, and you access all such information and
          content at your own risk, and we aren’t liable for any errors or
          omissions in that information or content or for any damages or loss
          you might suffer in connection with it. We cannot control and have no
          duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the
          Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been
          exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability
          for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services.
          We can’t guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in
          using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access
          to the Services. You are responsible for all Content you contribute,
          in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have
          all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute
          it. You will keep all your registration information accurate and
          current. You are responsible for all your activity in connection with
          the Services.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Services may contain links or connections to third party websites
          or services that are not owned or controlled by 4EVERLAND. When you
          access third party websites or use third party services, you accept
          that there are risks in doing so, and that 4EVERLAND is not
          responsible for such risks. We encourage you to be aware when you
          leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy
          policy of each third party website or service that you visit or
          utilize.
        </p>

        <p>
          4EVERLAND has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the
          content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions
          expressed in any third party websites or by any third party that you
          interact with through the Services. In addition, 4EVERLAND will not
          and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third
          party site or service. By using the Services, you release and hold us
          harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third
          party website or service.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or
          through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or
          services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or
          representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you
          and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever
          investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with
          any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties. You
          agree that 4EVERLAND shall not be responsible or liable for any loss
          or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.
        </p>

        <p>
          If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between
          users and any third party, you agree that 4EVERLAND is under no
          obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute
          with one or more other users, you release 4EVERLAND, its directors,
          officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and
          damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or
          unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way
          related to such disputes and/or our Services.
        </p>

        <p>Will 4EVERLAND ever change the Services?</p>

        <p>
          We’re always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over
          time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we
          may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or
          restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We reserve the right
          to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason
          (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed
          that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and
          without notice.
        </p>

        <p>Do the Services cost anything?</p>

        <p>
          The Services may be free or we may charge a fee for using the
          Services. If you are using a free version of the Services, we will
          notify you before any Services you are then using begin carrying a
          fee, and if you wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all
          applicable fees for such Services. Note that if you elect to receive
          text messages through the Services, data and message rates may apply.
          Any and all such charges, fees or costs are your sole responsibility.
          You should consult with your wireless carrier to determine what rates,
          charges, fees or costs may apply to your use of the Services.
        </p>

        <p>
          a.Paid Services. Certain of our Services may be subject to payments
          now or in the future (the “Paid Services”). Please see our Paid
          Services page for a description of the current Paid Services. Please
          note that any payment terms presented to you in the process of using
          or signing up for a Paid Service are deemed part of these Terms.
        </p>

        <p>
          b. Billing. We use a third-party payment processor (the “Payment
          Processor”) to bill you through a payment account linked to your
          account on the Services (your “Billing Account”) for use of the Paid
          Services. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms,
          conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition
          to these Terms. We are not responsible for error by the Payment
          Processor. By choosing to use Paid Services, you agree to pay us,
          through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in
          effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the
          applicable payment terms and you authorize us, through the Payment
          Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (your “Payment
          Method”). You agree to make payment using that selected Payment
          Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that
          the Payment Processor makes even if it has already requested or
          received payment
        </p>

        <p>
          c. Payment Method. The terms of your payment will be based on your
          Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the
          financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your
          chosen Payment Method. If we, through the Payment Processor, do not
          receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your
          Billing Account upon demand.
        </p>

        <p>
          d. Recurring Billing. Some of the Paid Services may consist of an
          initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by
          recurring period charges as agreed to by you. By choosing a recurring
          payment plan, you acknowledge that such Services have an initial and
          recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all
          recurring charges prior to cancellation. WE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC
          CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL
          YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT
          YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT
          METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE WE
          REASONABLY COULD ACT. TO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE YOUR
          PAYMENT METHOD, GO TO ACCOUNT SETTINGS.
        </p>

        <p>
          e. Current Information Required. YOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE
          AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT. YOU MUST PROMPTLY
          UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE
          AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER,
          OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR
          OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR
          LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF
          SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USER NAME
          OR PASSWORD. CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE AT ACCOUNT
          SETTINGS. IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU
          AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES
          UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR PAID
          SERVICES AS SET FORTH ABOVE.
        </p>

        <p>
          f. Change in Amount Authorized. If the amount to be charged to your
          Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than
          due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes),
          you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the
          amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled
          date of the transaction. Any agreement you have with your payment
          provider will govern your use of your Payment Method. You agree that
          we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more
          aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.
        </p>

        <p>
          g. Reaffirmation of Authorization. Your non-termination or continued
          use of a Paid Service reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your
          Payment Method for that Paid Service. We may submit those charges for
          payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not
          waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be
          payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described
          when you initially selected to use the Paid Service.
        </p>

        <p>
          Free Trials and Other Promotions. Any free trial or other promotion
          that provides access to a Paid Service must be used within the
          specified time of the trial. You must stop using a Paid Service before
          the end of the trial period in order to avoid being charged for that
          Paid Service. If you cancel prior to the end of the trial period and
          are inadvertently charged for a Paid Service, please contact us at
          <a href="mailto:support@4everland.org">support@4everland.org</a>
