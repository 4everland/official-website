        <p>
          This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable
          information (“Personal Information”) that we gather when you are

          various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in
          more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in
          connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and
          improve our services, to allow you to set up a user account and
          profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to

          16, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any
          personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have
          collected personal information from a child under age 16, we will
          delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a
          child under 16 may have provided us personal information, please

          We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to
          change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will
          alert you to changes by placing a notice on the Services, by sending
          you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve

          provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still
          govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for
          reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any
          changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree
          to all of the changes.

          Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security.
          If you access your account via a third party site or service, you may
          have additional or different sign-on protections via that third party

          your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have
          finished accessing your account.
        </p>

        <p>
          We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal
          Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot
          guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or

              process data due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such
              Personal Data will result in your inability to use some or all
              portions of the Services that require such data.
