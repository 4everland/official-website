      4EVERLAND is designed to solve this problem by providing a distributed,
      highly efficient, self-motivated, and low-cost data hosting gateway based
      on IPFS and the underlying technology of Ethereum. If free accounts, free
      contracts, and free assets are the foundation of Web 3.0, then the
      development protocol built by 4EVERLAND will be the access layer protocol
      of the Web 3.0 world, liberating Web 3.0 developers from the constraints
      of centralization, improve the robustness and security of the service, and
      provide a globally accelerated, ever-lasting network service for users.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Internet needs Web 3.0, a new generation of the Internet paradigm that
      advocates free identity, free contracts, and free assets, and blockchain
      technology provides a near-perfect solution to Web 3.0 with decentralized
      addresses as accounts, smart contracts for self-deployment and access, and
      Tokens that flow autonomously and frictionlessly. The free market creates
      prosperity and the blockchain business is growing rapidly, with liberal
      financial experience of DEFI, attracting hundreds of billions of dollars.
      Moreover, NFT is empowering art, sports and trendy culture has brought
      millions of incremental users to the blockchain world.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there is still an important part of the Web 3.0 paradigm of
      blockchain that is missing. &quot;I trust my Ethereum addresses, assets
      and smart contracts, however, what if the DAPP interface I'm accessing
      disappears or is blocked somedays in the future?&quot; I have a collection
      of valuable NFT digital artifacts that point to a single node storage
      server, will the value of the NFTs disappear with the shutdown of the
      server?&quot; What if my DEFI project is fast in Europe, but slow in Asia,
      affecting user experience? Clearly, the centralized, license-based,
      single-node data service model cannot meet the needs of the rapidly
      growing number of Web 3.0 users for service security and degree of
      freedom.

    <h3>Technical Overview of 4EVERLAND</h3>
    <p>
      4EVERLAND is a blockchain technology-powered cloud computing platform
      designed to help developers develop Web 3.0 applications efficiently, with
      technical features such as global acceleration, privacy protection, and
      distributed storage. It is built on consensus-driven Swarm on top of IPFS,
      significantly improves Data I/O efficiency, and TEE-based storage
      challenge proofs. It achieves more stable content storage, more efficient
      content distribution, faster network access, file reading, and storage
      fraud prevention.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, 4EVERLAND provides products and protocols such as DWeb
      hosting, decentralized gateway, decentralized domain name, digital
      marketing system, and data services to help developers access Web 3.0 in
      one click, and eventually build a globally accelerated, privacy-protected,
      link-perpetual distributed network and Web 3.0 infrastructure with IPFS.
    </p>
    <p>Here are some core technologies of 4EVERLAND:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em><strong>4EVER-STORAGE:</strong></em> 4EVERLAND forms nodes into a
          huge storage network through Swarm technology, relying on node
          cooperativeness to achieve persistent storage of specific data and
          supporting horizontal expansion of nodes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em><strong>4EVER-GATEWAY:</strong></em> The gateway nodes contain
          dynamic DNS, Data I/O, and Cert Manager modules, and developers can
          quickly realize safe and reliable global acceleration based on
          4EVERLAND through simple configuration.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em><strong>Storage Proof:</strong></em> 4EVERLAND builds Swarm
          distributed storage network based on IPFS protocol and proposes
          storage challenge proof PoSC based on TEE technology, ensuring the
          availability and reliability of data.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em><strong>Smart Contracts:</strong></em> 4EVERLAND's smart contract
          module mainly includes payment contracts, campaign contracts, lending
          contracts, control contracts. It achieves open, transparent and free
          decentralized governance through smart contracts.
