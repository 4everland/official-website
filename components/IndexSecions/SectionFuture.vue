        4EVERLAND is a great place to pursue developers' ideal paradigm for Web
        3.0, releasing them from the shackles of centeredness completely and
        creating more robust and secure services. We hope that more developers
        and scholars will join us along the way to build a globally accelerated,
        forever-linked network service for more users using 4EVERLAND, which is
        a distributed, highly efficient, self-motivated, and low-cost cloud
        computing network. Witness the radical change in server architecture
        together and the giant technical leaps in Web3.0.
