We at 4EVERLAND Foundation know you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By using or accessing the services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we can collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.
Remember that your use of Terminal’s Services is at all times subject to the Terms of Use, which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Use.
This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that we gather when you are accessing or using our services, but not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage. We gather various types of personal information from our users and use this information internally in connection with our services, including personalizing, providing, and improving our services. From setting up a user account and profile to contacting you and allowing other users to contact you, fulfilling your requests for certain products and services, to analyzing how you are using the services.
As noted in the Terms of Use, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 16. If you are under 16, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 16, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 16 may have provided us with personal information, please let us know at support@4everland.com
We’re constantly improving our services, so we may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will alert you of the changes by placing a notice on the services page, emailing you, or updating the same via other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all the changes.
What information does 4EVERLAND collect?
Information You Provide to Us:
– First and last name
– Email address
– Third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for GitHub.)
Certain information may be required to register with us and to take advantage of some of our features.
If you’ve provided us with your email address, then we may use it to send you follow-up updates or for promotional purposes. For example, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, or email you about your use of the services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more exciting and improve our services. If you want to unsubscribe from 4EVERLAND’s notification, then email us at support@4EVERLAND.com.
Information Collected Automatically.
Whenever you interact with our services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your geolocation data, device identification, the type of browser, and device you’re using to access our services, and the page or feature you requested. We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve the services – for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular service feature, and we then use that information to make our services exciting to as many users as possible.
Will 4EVERLAND share any of the Personal Information it receives?
We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:
Analytics: We may use third-party analytics service providers, such as Google Analytics for our business purposes, including but not limited to improving and developing our services, monitoring and analyzing the use of our services, and increasing the functionality and user-friendliness of our services. Google Analytics may collect and retain some information about you by planting a persistent cookie or identifier on your web browser or device. If you wish to opt out of Google Analytics, visit https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your use of the services is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Service and the Google Privacy Policy.

Protection of 4EVERLAND and Others: We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with applicable law or court order. From responding to valid legal processes, including from law enforcement or other government agencies; applying our Terms of Use and other agreements; preventing spam or other unwanted communications and investigating fraud; protecting the rights, property, or safety of 4EVERLAND, our employees, our users, and others; by maintaining the security of our products and services.
Is Personal Information about me secure?
Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. If you access your account via a third-party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that third-party site or service. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and personal information by selecting and protecting your password. Use other sign-on mechanisms appropriately, and limit access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.
We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other personal information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.

You may request deletion of your account by emailing us at support@4everland. Some information may remain in our records after your account deletion.
